Introduction: Venues of two cities, namely Toronto, and Calgary will be compared to explore their similarities. Data will be collected from foursquare.com
and postal code, borough, and neighborhood information will be collected from wikipedia. The goal of this project is to 
deterimine the change in lifestyle when a person migrate from one city to another, for example, a new job, or school etc.
Given the large amount of data foursquare provide, only top 10 venues will be considered when making comparison, and depending
on the size of neighborhoods exists in both city, the size of clusters will be adjusted.
