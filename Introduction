Introduction: Relocation is common among many jobs, and it is difficult decision to make. This project will explore the
downtown location of two major cities in two different provinces, namely Calgary and Toronto. Venues in both locations will be 
explored, and used for decision making.


Data: Location data will be scraped from websites, and collected from FourSquare. Calgary geographical data will be scraped 
from wikipedia, and explore venue data using FourSquare. All postal code, and its longitude and latitude values will be 
collected. However, only downtown area will be selected for processing. Toronto geographical data will be collected from
Week three project, as well as venues explored by FourSquare

Given the large amount of venu data from FourSquare, only the top 20 popular venues will be considered for comparison, and the
result will be displayed using graphical method.
